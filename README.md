### This repository contains two things:

1. A python flask server implementation for running the ARM template script
2. A web interface using JavaScript, HTML and CSS to call this script, present in the `ARM_TEMPL.

### Testing the python script/server

- open a new terminal and navigate to the working directory:

- Install requirements on the requirements.txt with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- To start the server use `flask --app server run`.

This will run the code on server

The web interface is in the `templates` folder.
